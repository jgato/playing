About the repository
=====================
Just a repository to put my different "HelloWords", tests and first contact with technologies that I am interested in. If you find something useful for you and If I have forgotten to specify a license... consider everything as OpenSource you cand do what you want with the code, in any case, it only contains a couple of "hellowords" and some copy/pastes ;)
